Bitcoin is the most well known blockchain technology based crytocurrency.

The central idea of bitcoin is to create a decentralised currency, issued and backed by no government, as medium of exchange. units of currency are created by being 'mined': computers do work, and are rewarded by receiving bitcoin. The decision about how much bitcoin in circulation at any given time is decided algorithmically, as opposed to being controlled by a central bank, with the algorithm adjusting how much work a computer needs to do to successfully mine a coin. Inflation is thus controlled.  

Another key feature of bitcoin is it's use of blockchain technology (and in fact its use of blockchain is tied to the mining and awarding of new bitcoin.)
