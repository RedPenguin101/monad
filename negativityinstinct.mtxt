The negativity instinct is the tendency of people to believe that things are getting worse, when statistically things are actually getting better.

The causes of the negativity instinct are:

* Rose tinted spectacles: people tend to scrub their minds of negative memories, and remember things as better than they actually were
* Media assymmetry in reporting negatives: Journalists tend to report more on negative things; disasters and tragedies, and worrying trends, whereas the positive counterparts, particularly the gradual improvement, are much less represented.
* The instinct to confuse 'bad' with 'getting worse':
