Statistical inference is the discipline of deriving general patterns in and conclusions about a broad population from experiments conducted on a sample from that population. There are two main paradigms which are used to do this: The Frequentist Approach and the Bayesian approach.

THe Frequentist approach emphasises the frequency of the data, whereas the Bayesian Approach is based on the concept of a prior estimate of probability, with experimental results serving to refine and improve that idea.
